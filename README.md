## ❓ What is valorant-tool-kit?
valorant-tool-kit is a lightweight external overlay and utility suite built for modern Windows 10/11 systems. It runs entirely outside the target process — no code injection, no driver hooks — and renders a clean ImGui-based HUD on top of the active window. The feature set is focused: a low-overhead rendering path, sensible defaults, and an override-friendly config file so experienced users can dial the tool in for their own hardware and workflow. Typical use-cases include monitoring overlays, quick on-screen reference panels, and private practice/testing sessions against local bots.
